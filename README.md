<h1>Conclusion after completion of the practical part of Beca</h1>

I was extremely pleased with the way Beca worked. I believe that if I had meetings like the traditional ones, I wouldn't have learned as much as chasing knowledge on my own.

I wish I had taken advantage of the last week to make a new project and make the sub-theme better. As I went on vacation I am delivering it this way but I will make a new one for my knowledge.

Thank you Ruda for the way you led and willingness to help.
